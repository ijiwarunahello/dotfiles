# Skill Harness Testing

Automated quality verification for everything-evenhub skills. Each skill has a test case that simulates a real developer request, executes via a subagent, and validates the output against a structured checklist.

## How It Works

```
1. Implementer subagent
   - Receives: skill SKILL.md content + simulated user request
   - Executes in isolated directory: harness/.output/<skill-name>/
   - Produces: project files, code, or answers

2. Verifier subagent
   - Receives: verification checklist for the skill
   - Reads actual output files on disk
   - Reports: PASS/FAIL per item + skill improvement suggestions
```

## Running a Test

Upstream runs this from Claude Code in the everything-evenhub directory:

```
/harness quickstart
```

Or manually dispatch:

1. Read `harness/cases/<skill-name>.md` for the test case
2. Dispatch an implementer subagent with the skill content + test prompt
3. Dispatch a verifier subagent with `harness/checklists/<skill-name>.md`
4. Review results and apply any skill improvements

## Directory Structure

```
harness/
  README.md              # This file
  HARNESS.md             # Upstream harness runner notes, not a Codex skill
  cases/                  # Test case definitions (user prompt + context)
    quickstart.md
    ...
  checklists/             # Verification checklists
    quickstart.md
    ...
  .output/                # Generated test output (gitignored)
```

## Adding a New Test

1. Create `harness/cases/<skill-name>.md` with the simulated user request
2. Create `harness/checklists/<skill-name>.md` with the verification checklist
3. Run the test and iterate on the skill until all checks pass

## Audit Tests

In addition to per-skill tests, two audit tests validate skill content itself:

- **`/harness cross-check`** — scans all skills for contradictory claims (e.g., one skill says `borderColor: 0–15`, another says `0–16`). No implementer subagent needed.
- **`/harness sdk-ground-truth`** — compares skill documentation against the actual SDK `.d.ts` type definitions. Catches drift when the SDK updates but skills lag behind.

These should be run periodically (e.g., after SDK upgrades or bulk skill edits).

## Success Criteria

- All checklist items PASS
- No FAIL items caused by unclear skill guidance (vs. agent error)
- Skill improvements are committed back to the skill file
