description: Package and deploy an Even Hub G2 app — validate app.json, build, pack into .ehpk, and prepare for submission. Use when packaging, deploying, publishing, or submitting an Even Hub app.
---

You are packaging an Even Hub G2 app for distribution. Follow the steps below carefully, validating each stage before proceeding.

## Packaging Workflow

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1 — Validate app.json

1. Locate `app.json` in the project root.
2. Read the file and validate every field against the field reference below.
3. If any field is missing, has the wrong type, or fails a validation rule, report the exact error and fix it (with user confirmation if the fix changes meaningful values like `package_id` or `name`).
4. Do not proceed until `app.json` is valid.

### Step 2 — Build

Run the build command from the project root:

```bash
npm run build
```

Check that the build succeeds (exit code 0) and that the output folder (typically `dist/`) exists and is non-empty.

### Step 3 — Pack into .ehpk

Run the pack command, substituting the app name for `<name>`:

```bash
npx evenhub pack app.json dist -o <name>.ehpk
```

Use the value of the `name` field from `app.json` (lowercased, spaces replaced with hyphens) as `<name>`. For example, if `name` is "Weather Now", use `weather-now.ehpk`.

### Step 4 — Verify output

Confirm the `.ehpk` file was created:

```bash
ls -lh <name>.ehpk
```

If the file is missing, check the error output from the pack command and consult the troubleshooting table below.

### Step 5 — Distribute

Submit the `.ehpk` file to the Even Hub developer portal for review and publication.

## app.json Field Reference

Every field is required unless noted. Validate each field before running `evenhub pack`.

| Field | Type | Required | Validation rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `package_id` | string | yes | Reverse-domain format (e.g. `com.example.myapp`). Lowercase letters and digits only — no hyphens, no uppercase, no underscores. Minimum 2 dot-separated segments. Each segment must start with a lowercase letter and contain only lowercase letters or digits. |
| `edition` | string | yes | Must be exactly `"202601"`. |
| `name` | string | yes | Maximum 20 characters. |
| `version` | string | yes | Semver format `x.y.z` — three numeric parts separated by dots (e.g. `"1.0.0"`). No `v` prefix, no pre-release suffixes. |
| `min_app_version` | string | yes | Minimum Even Hub app version required. E.g. `"2.0.0"`. |
| `min_sdk_version` | string | yes | Minimum SDK version required. E.g. `"0.0.10"`. |
| `entrypoint` | string | yes | Path to the entry HTML/JS file, relative to the build output folder. The file must exist inside the build output after `npm run build`. |
| `permissions` | array | yes | Array of permission objects (see Permissions Reference). Can be empty `[]`. Must NOT be a key-value map. |
| `supported_languages` | array | yes | Array of BCP 47 language codes from the supported set. Valid values: `en`, `de`, `fr`, `es`, `it`, `zh`, `ja`, `ko`. |

### Minimal valid app.json example

```json
{
  "package_id": "com.example.weatherapp",
  "edition": "202601",
  "name": "Weather Now",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "min_app_version": "2.0.0",
  "min_sdk_version": "0.0.10",
  "entrypoint": "index.html",
  "permissions": [],
  "supported_languages": ["en"]
}
```

---

## Permissions Reference

`permissions` must be an **array of objects**. Each object has:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | yes | One of the valid permission names listed below. |
| `desc` | string | yes | Human-readable description, 1–300 characters. |
| `whitelist` | string[] | only for `network` | List of allowed URLs. Required when `name` is `"network"`. |

### Valid permission names

- `network` — outbound network access (requires `whitelist`)
- `location` — device GPS/location data
- `g2-microphone` — microphone on the G2 glasses
- `phone-microphone` — microphone on the paired phone
- `album` — access to the photo album
- `camera` — access to the camera

### Example

```json
"permissions": [
  {
    "name": "network",
    "desc": "Fetches weather data from the API.",
    "whitelist": ["https://api.weather.com"]
  },
  {
    "name": "g2-microphone",
    "desc": "Enables voice commands for hands-free control."
  }
]
```

### Common mistake

Do NOT use a key-value map format:

```json
// WRONG
"permissions": { "network": ["example.com"] }

// CORRECT
"permissions": [{ "name": "network", "desc": "...", "whitelist": ["example.com"] }]
```

## CORS in the WebView

The Even App runs your plugin inside a real browser engine (Chromium on Android, WKWebView on iOS). **Full CORS enforcement applies.** The `app.json` network whitelist is an Even-level permission check — it does NOT bypass CORS. You need BOTH:

1. The domain whitelisted in `app.json` `permissions.network.whitelist`, AND
2. The remote API to respond with the correct CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, etc.)

If the API you're calling doesn't send CORS headers, `fetch()` will fail with a network error even though the domain is whitelisted.

| Scenario | Fix |
|---|---|
| API has CORS headers | Just whitelist the domain in `app.json` — it works |
| API has no CORS headers | Use your own backend, a Cloudflare Worker proxy (free tier), or find a CORS-enabled mirror |
| Dev server (localhost) is blocked by CORS | Add a Vite proxy in `vite.config.ts` — see below |

### Vite dev proxy

Use a Vite proxy to avoid CORS during local development:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'https://api.example.com',
        changeOrigin: true,
        rewrite: (p) => p.replace(/^\/api/, ''),
      },
    },
  },
})
```

This proxy only works in dev. For the production `.ehpk`, the WebView makes requests directly — your API must have CORS headers, or you must route through your own proxy.

### Free CORS proxy services are unreliable

Public proxies like `corsproxy.io`, `allorigins.win`, and `api.codetabs.com` go down, return 403s, or timeout without warning. If your app depends on a third-party API without CORS, deploy your own Cloudflare Worker (free tier, ~5 min setup) or find a mirror that serves CORS headers natively.

Simulator success does not prove WebView success. The simulator may not reproduce iPhone WKWebView CORS failures, so run at least one device check for apps that fetch remote APIs.

## evenhub pack Options

```
npx evenhub pack <app.json> <build-folder> [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-o <file>` / `--output <file>` | Output filename. Defaults to `out.ehpk` if not specified. |
| `--no-ignore` | Include dotfiles and other normally-ignored files in the package. |
| `-c` / `--check` | Check whether the `package_id` is available on the Even Hub store before packing. |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Invalid package id` | Use lowercase reverse-domain format with a minimum of 2 dot-separated segments. No hyphens, no uppercase letters, no underscores, no segments starting with a digit. Example: `com.example.myapp`. |
| `name: must be 20 characters or fewer` | Shorten the `name` value in `app.json` to 20 characters or fewer. |
| `version: must be in x.y.z format` | Use a three-part numeric semver string such as `"1.0.0"`. Do not use `"1.0"`, `"v1.0.0"`, or pre-release tags. |
| `min_app_version: expected string, received undefined` | `min_app_version` is required. Add it to `app.json` (e.g. `"2.0.0"`). |
| `min_sdk_version: expected string, received undefined` | `min_sdk_version` is required. Add it to `app.json` (e.g. `"0.0.10"`). |
| `permissions: each permission must be an object with name and desc keys` | `permissions` must be an array of objects, each with `name` and `desc`. See the Permissions Reference above. |
| `supported_languages: invalid language` | Use only the supported lowercase ISO codes: `en`, `de`, `fr`, `es`, `it`, `zh`, `ja`, `ko`. |
| `Entrypoint file not found` | Ensure `entrypoint` in `app.json` points to a file that exists inside the build output folder after running `npm run build`. |
| `Project folder not found` | The build output folder does not exist. Run `npm run build` first, then retry `evenhub pack`. |

## Distribution

Once the `.ehpk` file is verified, submit it to the **Even Hub developer portal** for review and publication. The portal will validate the package, run compatibility checks, and make the app available to Even Hub G2 users after approval.
